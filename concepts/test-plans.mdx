## What is a test plan?

A test plan is a set of natural language instructions that tell the AI what to test on your website. Instead of writing code or CSS selectors, you describe the user flow in plain English.

The AI reads your instructions, analyzes the page, and decides which actions to take to complete the test.

## Tips for good test plans

### Be specific about elements

Use exact button text, labels, or unique identifiers when referring to elements.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Click the "Start free trial" button.
Click the "Subscribe to Pro" link in the pricing table.
```

```text Avoid
Click the button.
Click the signup thing.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Break flows into clear steps

Write sequential steps that describe the user journey from start to finish.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Navigate to the contact page.
Fill in the name field with "Test User".
Fill in the email field with "test@example.com".
Click "Submit".
Verify a success message appears.
```

```text Avoid
Test the contact form and make sure it works.
```
</CodeGroup>

### State explicit success criteria

Tell the AI exactly what success looks like. Use "verify" statements to check conditions.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Verify the confirmation message appears.
Verify the URL changes to "/dashboard".
Verify the checkout form loads with the correct plan name.
```

```text Avoid
Make sure everything works.
Check if it's successful.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Mention form field labels

When filling forms, reference the visible label or placeholder text.

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Enter "user@example.com" in the email field.
Enter "password123" in the password field.
```

```text Avoid
Type the email.
Fill in the credentials.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example test plans

### Payment flow

```text
Go to /pricing.
Click the "Pro" plan card.
Click "Subscribe".
Verify the checkout form loads.
Verify the plan name shows "Pro - $29/month".
```

### Contact form submission

```text
Navigate to the contact page.
Fill in the name field with "Test User".
Fill in the email field with "test@example.com".
Fill in the message field with "This is a test message".
Click the "Submit" button.
Verify a success message appears.
```

### Login flow

```text
Click "Sign in" in the navigation.
Enter "user@example.com" in the email field.
Enter "password123" in the password field.
Click "Log in".
Verify the dashboard loads.
Verify the user name appears in the header.
```

### Add to cart

```text
Navigate to the shop page.
Click on the first product card.
Select size "Medium" from the dropdown.
Click "Add to cart".
Verify the cart icon shows "1 item".
Click the cart icon.
Verify the product appears in the cart with size "Medium".
```

## Built-in templates

Flowly provides starter templates for common flows:

- **Payment flow**: Test checkout and subscription processes
- **Contact form**: Test form submissions and validation
- **Add to cart**: Test e-commerce shopping cart flows
- **Login flow**: Test authentication and session handling

You can customize these templates to match your specific website.

<Tip>
Start simple and iterate. If the AI doesn't follow your intended path, refine your instructions to be more specific about element labels or add intermediate verification steps.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Avoid vague instructions like "test the website" or "check everything works". The AI needs specific, actionable steps to execute your test successfully.
</Warning>
