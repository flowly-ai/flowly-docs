## Overview

Stay informed about test results without constantly watching the dashboard. Flowly sends email notifications for test completions, scheduled run results, and quota alerts.

## Types of notifications

### Test completion

When you queue a test manually, you can opt in to receive an email when the test finishes. This is useful for long-running tests where you don't want to wait in the dashboard.

**Notification includes**:
- Test case name
- Pass/fail status
- Link to view full results

### Scheduled test results

Scheduled tests automatically send email notifications after each run if you configured an email address when creating the schedule.

**Notification includes**:
- Test case name
- Target URL
- Pass/fail result
- Timestamp
- Link to view detailed results with screenshots

### Quota exceeded

If a scheduled test can't execute because you've exhausted your monthly quota, Flowly sends an alert email.

**Notification includes**:
- Which test was skipped
- Current quota usage
- Next quota reset date
- Link to upgrade your plan

## Setting up notifications

### For scheduled tests

Add an email address when creating or editing a schedule:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open schedule settings">
    Go to the test case and click **Add Schedule** or **Edit** on an existing schedule
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter email address">
    Fill in the **Notification email** field with the address that should receive results
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Create** or **Update** to activate notifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For manual test runs

Opt in to notifications when queuing a test:

1. Click **Run test** on any test case
2. Look for the **Notify me when complete** banner while the test is queued
3. Click the banner to enable email notification for this run

<Note>
  Manual test notification preferences are per-run, not saved to the test case. You must opt in each time you run a test manually.
</Note>

## Email content

### Successful test notification

When a test passes, the email contains:
- Test case name
- URL that was tested
- "Passed" status with a checkmark
- Execution time
- Link to view step-by-step results

### Failed test notification

When a test fails, the email contains:
- Test case name
- URL that was tested
- "Failed" status with details
- Which step failed
- AI reasoning for the failure
- Link to view full results and debug

<Tip>
  Use a shared team email (e.g., qa-team@yourcompany.com) for scheduled test notifications so everyone stays informed about test results.
</Tip>

    Reserve notifications for important flows. Not every test needs an email alert.

## Managing notifications

### Update email addresses

Change the notification email for a schedule:

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Schedules**
2. Click on the schedule
3. Click **Edit**
4. Update the **Notification email** field
5. Save changes

The new email address will receive all future notifications for that schedule.

### Disable notifications

Remove notifications from a schedule:

1. Edit the schedule
2. Clear the **Notification email** field
3. Save

The test will continue running on schedule but won't send email notifications.

### Unsubscribe from notifications

If you no longer want to receive notifications:

1. Click the **Unsubscribe** link at the bottom of any notification email
2. Confirm your choice

<Warning>
  Unsubscribing removes you from all Flowly notifications, including quota alerts. Update individual schedule settings instead if you only want to stop specific notifications.
</Warning>

## Email delivery

Flowly sends emails from `notifications@useflowly.ai`. Ensure this address is:
- Not blocked by your spam filter
- Added to your contacts or safe senders list
- Allowed through your organization's email security policies

If you're not receiving expected notifications, check your spam folder and email filtering rules.
