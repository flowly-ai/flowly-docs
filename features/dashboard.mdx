## Overview

The dashboard is your central hub after signing in. It provides quick access to test cases, run history, schedules, and account settings.

## Dashboard sections

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Overview" icon="chart-pie">
    Quick stats showing total test cases, active schedules, and quota usage for the current billing cycle.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Test cases" icon="vials">
    Browse, search, create, and manage all your test cases in one place.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Run history" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    View results from recent test runs with pass/fail status, timestamps, and links to detailed results.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Schedules" icon="calendar-days">
    View and manage all active and paused schedules across your account.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Overview panel

The overview panel displays:

- **Total test cases**: Number of active test cases in your account
- **Active schedules**: Number of schedules currently running
- **Quota usage**: Tests used this month out of your plan's monthly limit
- **Billing cycle**: Days remaining until quota resets

This panel gives you a snapshot of your testing activity without needing to navigate multiple pages.

## Test cases

The test cases section shows all your saved test configurations. From here you can:

- **Create new test cases**: Click **New Test Case** to add a test
- **Search and filter**: Find specific tests by name or URL
- **Run tests**: Execute any test case immediately
- **Edit or delete**: Manage existing test cases
- **View run history**: See all previous runs for a specific test case

### Test case list

Each test case shows:
- Name and target URL
- Last run timestamp and status
- Number of total runs
- Quick actions (Run, Edit, Delete)

Click on any test case to see its full details and complete run history.

## Run history

The run history section displays recent test executions across all test cases:

- **Timestamp**: When the test started
- **Test case name**: Which test was executed
- **Status**: Pass or fail
- **Duration**: Total execution time
- **Actions**: Link to view detailed results

### Filtering history

Use filters to narrow down runs:
- **Status**: Show only passed or failed tests
- **Date range**: View runs from specific time periods
- **Test case**: Filter by a specific test case

## Test viewer

Click any test run to open the detailed test viewer, which shows:

- **Step-by-step replay**: Screenshots from each step of the test
- **Actions taken**: What the AI did at each step (clicked, typed, navigated, etc.)
- **AI reasoning**: Why the AI chose each action
- **Pass/fail status**: Whether each step succeeded or failed
- **Execution time**: How long each step took

The test viewer helps you debug failures by showing exactly what happened during execution.

<Tip>
  Use the test viewer to refine your test plans. If the AI took an unexpected action, check its reasoning to understand why and adjust your instructions accordingly.
</Tip>

## Schedules

The schedules section lists all automated test schedules:

- **Test case name**: Which test is scheduled
- **Frequency**: How often it runs (daily, weekly, custom)
- **Next run**: When the next execution is scheduled
- **Status**: Active or paused

From here you can:
- Toggle schedules on/off
- Edit schedule settings
- Delete schedules
- View notification settings

## Profile and settings

Access your profile from the dashboard to:

- **View subscription tier**: See your current plan (Free, Starter, Pro)
- **Manage billing**: Update payment method or change plans
- **Access customer portal**: View invoices and billing history through the Polar customer portal
- **Check usage**: Review quota consumption and billing cycle dates

## Usage tracking

Monitor your monthly test quota consumption:

- **Tests used**: Number of tests run this billing cycle
- **Tests remaining**: Available tests until quota resets
- **Reset date**: When your quota will refresh

<Warning>
  If you exhaust your monthly quota, both manual and scheduled tests will be blocked until the next billing cycle. Upgrade your plan if you consistently hit quota limits.
</Warning>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organize test cases with naming conventions">
    Use prefixes or suffixes to group related tests (e.g., "Checkout - ", "Login - "). This makes searching and filtering easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review run history regularly">
    Check for patterns in failures. Consistent failures in specific test cases may indicate brittle tests or site issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor quota early in billing cycle">
    If you're approaching your limit mid-cycle, consider upgrading to avoid blocked tests later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use the test viewer for debugging">
    Don't just check pass/fail status. Review the AI's reasoning to improve your test plans over time.
  </Accordion>
