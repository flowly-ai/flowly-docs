## What are test cases

Test cases are reusable configurations that contain a name, target URL, and test plan. You can run them repeatedly without re-entering the same details each time.

Each test case stores:
- A descriptive name
- The target URL to test
- A test plan written in natural language
- A complete run history with timestamps and results

## Creating a test case

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to test cases">
    Go to **Dashboard** > **Test Cases** > **New Test Case**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the details">
    Enter the following fields:

    - **Name**: A descriptive identifier for this test case
    - **Target URL**: The starting page for your test
    - **Test plan**: Instructions in natural language describing what to test

    ```
    Example test plan:
    Navigate to the pricing page.
    Click the "Start free trial" button.
    Fill in the email field with "test@example.com".
    Verify the signup form appears.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and run">
    Click **Create** to save your test case. You can run it immediately or schedule it for later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Name test cases descriptively (e.g., "Checkout flow - Pro plan monthly" not "Test 1"). This makes it easier to find and manage tests as your library grows.
</Tip>

## Managing test cases

### Edit a test case

Update the name, URL, or test plan anytime:

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Test Cases**
2. Click on the test case you want to edit
3. Click **Edit**
4. Make your changes and click **Save**

### Delete a test case

Flowly uses soft-deletion, which means deleted test cases can be restored:

1. Select the test case from your list
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

The test case will move to a "Deleted" view where you can restore or permanently remove it.

### Restore a deleted test case

To recover a test case:

1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Test Cases** > **Deleted**
2. Find the test case you want to restore
3. Click **Restore**

The test case will return to your active list with all its run history intact.

## Run history

Each test case automatically tracks all previous runs with:
- Timestamps for when each test started and completed
- Pass/fail status
- Links to detailed results with screenshots and AI reasoning

When you run a test from a test case, the results automatically link back to the test case for easy tracking and comparison over time.

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Name test cases based on the feature or flow they test, not generic labels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep URLs consistent" icon="link">
    Use the same base URL for related tests to group them logically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review run history" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Check previous runs before making changes to see what worked before.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Archive unused tests" icon="box-archive">
    Delete test cases you no longer need instead of letting them clutter your dashboard.
