## Overview

Scheduling lets you run tests automatically on a recurring basis without manual intervention. Set up schedules to catch issues early, monitor production sites continuously, or validate deployments automatically.

<Note>
  Schedules require a Starter or Pro plan. Free tier users can manually run tests but cannot create automated schedules.
</Note>

## Creating a schedule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a test case">
    Navigate to the test case you want to schedule from **Dashboard** > **Test Cases**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a schedule">
    Click **Add Schedule** and configure the following:

    - **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or specific days
    - **Time**: When the test should run
    - **Timezone**: Select from all IANA timezones
    - **Notification email** (optional): Email address to receive results
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate the schedule">
    Click **Create** to activate the schedule. Your test will run automatically at the specified time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily">
    Runs every day at the specified time.

    **Example use case**: Monitor a production checkout flow daily to catch issues before customers do.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Weekly">
    Runs on selected days of the week (Monday through Sunday).

    **Example use case**: Run regression tests every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after deployment windows.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom">
    Choose specific days and times for more control.

    **Example use case**: Test a marketing landing page only on weekdays when the team is available to respond.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing schedules

### View all schedules

Go to **Dashboard** > **Schedules** to see all active and paused schedules across your account.

### Toggle on/off

Pause a schedule temporarily without deleting it:

1. Find the schedule in your list
2. Click the **toggle switch** to pause or resume

This preserves all schedule settings while preventing execution.

### Edit a schedule

Update the frequency, time, or timezone:

1. Click on the schedule
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make your changes and save

The next run will use the updated settings.

### Delete a schedule

Remove a schedule when you no longer need it:

1. Click on the schedule
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

Deleting a schedule does not delete the underlying test case or its run history.

## Notifications

Add an email address when creating or editing a schedule to receive automatic notifications:

- **Test results**: Pass/fail status after each scheduled run
- **Execution summary**: Link to view full results with screenshots
- **Quota alerts**: Warning when a scheduled run can't execute due to exhausted quota

<Tip>
  Use a shared team email (e.g., dev-team@yourcompany.com) to keep everyone informed about scheduled test results.
</Tip>

## Quota usage

Each scheduled run counts toward your monthly test quota:

- **Starter plan**: 50 tests per month
- **Pro plan**: 150 tests per month

If your quota is exhausted, scheduled runs will skip execution and send a notification email. Manual test runs will also be blocked until your quota resets.

Your quota resets on your billing cycle start date. Check current usage in **Dashboard** > **Usage**.

<Warning>
  Ensure your test case URL is accessible from the internet (no localhost or private IPs). Scheduled tests run from Flowly's infrastructure and cannot access local development servers.
</Warning>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose appropriate frequency">
    Balance test coverage with quota limits. Daily tests are great for critical flows, but weekly may suffice for less critical features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Align with deployment schedules">
    Run tests after deployments when changes are most likely to introduce issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set realistic timezones">
    Schedule tests during business hours so your team can respond quickly to failures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor quota usage">
    Keep an eye on your monthly usage to avoid unexpected test failures at the end of your billing cycle.
