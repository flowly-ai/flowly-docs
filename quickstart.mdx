  <Step title="Sign up">
    Create an account at [useflowly.ai](https://useflowly.ai). A free tier is available to get started.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a test case">
    1. Go to **Dashboard** > **Test Cases** > **New**
    2. Enter a name for your test (e.g., "Homepage signup flow")
    3. Enter the target URL (e.g., "https://yoursite.com")
    4. Write a test plan in plain English:

    ```
    Navigate to the pricing page.
    Click the "Start free trial" button.
    Verify the signup form appears.
    ```

    <Tip>Be specific about button text and labels. The AI uses these to locate elements.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your test">
    Click **Run test**. Flowly opens a headless browser, uses AI to follow your instructions, and streams live screenshots back to your dashboard.

    You'll see each step execute in real-time with visual feedback.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review results">
    Once complete, you'll see:
    - Step-by-step screenshots of the test execution
    - Action logs showing what the AI did at each step
    - Pass/fail status with reasoning for each action
    - Total execution time and iteration count

    Each step includes the AI's reasoning for why it took that action.
