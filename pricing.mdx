## Quotas

### How quotas work

Your monthly test quota limits how many tests you can run in a billing cycle:
- Each test run (manual or scheduled) counts as one test
- Quota resets on your billing cycle start date
- Unused quota rolls over to the next month, capped at 2x your plan's monthly limit

### Quota enforcement

Flowly checks your quota before test execution:
- If quota is available, the test runs normally
- If quota is exhausted, the test is blocked and won't execute
- You'll receive a notification email if a scheduled test is blocked due to quota

### Monitoring usage

Track your quota consumption in real-time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to dashboard">
    Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Overview**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check quota panel">
    View your current usage, remaining tests, and reset date
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review run history">
    See which tests consumed quota and when
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Plan ahead if you're approaching your quota limit. Blocked tests can miss critical issues in production.
</Warning>
